Ironhack Project #1 : The Game<br>
<b>By Kathleen Domingo <i>(with the help of the Ironhack team and classmates)</i></b>

<h4>Go The F* To Sleep</h4> is a fun (I hope so) and simple game (with hundred lines of code)
dedicated to parents all around the world who have struggled / still struggling to make their child/ren sleep.<br><br>

If you are not a parent yet, then you'll get a glimpse of how it is by playing this game. :P <br><br>

Here, all you need to do is collect 50 sheep in 30 seconds (I wish it's this easy in real life). And if time is not enough, you'll get up to three glasses of wine (at least, this is possible).
Each glass gives you additional 10 seconds. <br>
Easy right? But of course, to frustrate YOU the player, some obstacles are added that
could slow you down by 2 seconds when "touched". So avoid the toys and sweets that could hype up the child!<br><br>

Enjoy!<br><br>
