# go-the-f-to-sleep-game
Ironhack Project #1 : The Game
By Kathleen Domingo (with the help of the Ironhack team and classmates)

<h2>Go The F* To Sleep</h2> is a fun (I hope so) and simple game (with hundred lines of code)<br>
dedicated to parents all around the world who have struggled / still struggling to make their child/ren sleep.<br>
If you are not a parent yet, then you'll get a glimpse of how it is by playing this game. :P <br><br>

Here, all you need to do is collect 50 sheep in 30 seconds. And if that is not enough, you'll get up to three glasses of wine.<br>
Each glass gives you additional 10 seconds. Easy right? But of course, to frustrate the player, I added some obstacles that <br>
could slow you down by 2 seconds when "touched". So avoid the toys and sweets that could hype up the child!<br><br>

Enjoy!
